I have run the Python script succesfully on
- Python 3.6.3 with NumPy 1.13.3, MatPlotLib 2.1.0, and Argparse 1.1 on Windows 10, as well as on
- Python 2.7.9 with NumPy 1.8.2, MatPlotlib 1.4.2, and Argparse 1.1 on Debian Linux 3.16,

so it will probably work on many other versions of these packages, Python and operating systems.

I have tried to make the command line flags self-explanatory


The commands in the example shell script were written for Bash 4.3.30 using Parellel 20130922 on Debian Linux
