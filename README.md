I have run the Python script succesfully on
Python 3.6.3 with NumPy 1.13.3, MatPlotLib 2.1.0, and Argparse 1.1 on Windows 10, as well as on
Python 2.7.9 with NumPy 1.8.2, MatPlotlib 1.4.2, and Argparse 1.1 on Debian Linux 3.16,
so it will probably work on many other versions of these packages, Python and operating systems.

I have tried to make the command line flags self-explanatory


The example shell script were written for Bash 4.3.30 using Parellel 20130922 on Debian Linux
