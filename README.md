This script accompanies "Viscous control of cellular respiration by membrane lipid composition" by Itay Budin, Tristan de Rond, Yan Chen, Leanne Jade G. Chan, Christopher J. Petzold, and Jay D. Keasling (https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aat7925)

If you use this script in your research, please cite the above paper.

For a description of our model, please refer to the Supplementary Information of the above paper.

I have run the Python script succesfully on
- Python 3.6.3 with NumPy 1.13.3, MatPlotLib 2.1.0, and Argparse 1.1 on Windows 10, as well as on
- Python 2.7.9 with NumPy 1.8.2, MatPlotlib 1.4.2, and Argparse 1.1 on Debian Linux 3.16,

so it will probably work on many other versions of these packages, Python and operating systems.

I have tried to make the command line flags self-explanatory. Run `python ETCsimulation.py --help`
to see all options and explanations


The commands in the example shell script were written for Bash 4.3.30 using Parallel 20130922
on Debian Linux
